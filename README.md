# **INSTALLATION GUIDE**

You can install the main hud file like normal, i.e., drop the "menthahud-main" folder into tf/custom.

## LYRAS NOTES PELASE READ IMPORTANT
Make sure the MingLiU-ExtB font is installed on your OS. I swapped out MingLiU for it due to missing characters and broken font rendering on Linux.

Some of the changes I did:

- The 30 second countdown and speedometer is disabled (you can re-enable if you want to)
- Killfeed is monochrome
- Chat font was changed to MingLiU-ExtB
- Fixed scoreboard name alignment from the scream fortress update
- Fixed main menu party chat font size from the scream fortress update
- Fixed the MVP round end panel thingy to work on 4k
- Stole @tekunotri's pull request (https://github.com/myria666/menthahud/pull/2)
- and probably some other things idk i forgor xD

## recommended hud commands

1. use tf_hud_target_id_alpha 255 or else it breaks
2. I don't suggest changing the "HP Buff" color because I use it in a lot of other hud elements

## Warnings and Precautions and Broken Things and Such

Firstly, I have made this hud using 16:9 1920x1080. In my videos using 4:3 windowed with no black bars or stretched, the main menu is a little bit weird. Still definitely usable as normal. I cannot guarantee it works nicely on ultrawide or other weirder resolutions, so just be warned if you do mess with your res. As well, I am running Windows 10. A friend tested this hud on Linux and some things broke due to file directory names including caps but they were also missing default TF2/HL2 fonts so their computer might have just been fucked to begin with. No idea. Just be aware if it breaks, I guess.

Please note that because the above commands only controls how queueing for Casual looks, this means that as of right now **Competitive** and **MVM** queue screens are kind of messed up and I am too lazy right now to fix that given I have not queued for these gamemodes in forever. Arguably it would be a beneficial feature if the comp queue screen was so broken it was impossible to use.

Unless there is something drastically wrong with the hud idk if I will be maintaining it that much. This is more of a personal thing that a bunch of people got interested in more than a proper project Intended For People To Use Actually. Let me know in the comments for the YouTube video I posted for the hud because as of the time of writing I am dealing with some shit and so my discord/twitter/etc are not publicly accessible.

Special thanks to Mentha Nolana (@menthalovely) for permission in using her wonderful art on the loading screens, backpack, and health indicator
